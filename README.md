# View it on GitHub

You know those "View it on GitHub" links at the bottom of emails from pull
requests? When you have one of those messages open, this extension opens the
link in a new tab. When you're looking at a thread of those messages, it opens
the last (most recent) link.

## Installation

* Clone this repository
* Open up chrome://extensions in Chrome
* Check the "Developer mode" box in the top right
* Click the "Load unpacked extension..." button
* Select the cloned repository folder
* Voila

## Deleting the email

Eventually, hopefully, this extension will open the GitHub URL in a new tab *and
then delete the email*. It turns out deleting an email is tricky and frustrating
(the button doesn't even exist in the DOM until you mouseover it, for example),
and therefore a work in progress.
